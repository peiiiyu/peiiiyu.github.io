				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>In the opening paragraph <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>, the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. First, it contains the keyword <q>disaster</q>, which is discussed throughout the entire essay. In addition, the key phrases <q>five times more</q> indicates that the focus will be on the inequality between generations.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>Drawing on multiple climate and demographic models, Thiery and 36 colleagues compared the risks faced by previous generations to the number of extreme events today’s children will witness in their lifetimes. <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">Unless world leaders agree on more ambitious policies when they meet for the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, this fall, the study says, today’s children will be exposed to an average of five times more disasters than if they lived 150 years ago.</span></q></p>

				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author quotes the statement of the author of the study that quantifies the times of climate disasters children are going to have. In the statements, Thiery implies some possible solutions to the climate crisis faced by people as young as his kids. For example, the author shows that the goal of adults is to <q>earn back children’s trust</q> by <q>making the dramatic emissions reductions that have been so long delayed</q>. The author also quotes Thiery's hopeful attitude toward reducing planet warming, like <q>We can still avoid the worst consequences</q>. In addition, the author quotes Thiery's calling to adults and parents like <q>That is what gives me strength as a father. … Their future is in our hands</q>. Thus, we can see that in general, the author tries to convince people that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">It is necessary and urgent to take action on curbing emissions from now on, and it will never be too late or useless for the children</span>.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>And adults must earn back children’s trust, Thiery said, by making the dramatic emissions reductions that have been so long delayed. Our choices now will determine whether kids grow up in a world with four times as many heat waves or seven times as many heat waves, a world with occasional crop failures or chronic food shortages. “We can still avoid the worst consequences,” he said. “That is what gives me strength as a father. … Their future is in our hands.”</q></p>
