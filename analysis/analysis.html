				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>In the opening paragraph <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>, the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. First, it contains the keyword <q>disaster</q>, which is discussed throughout the entire essay. In addition, the key phrases <q>five times more</q> indicates that the focus will be on the inequality between generations.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>Drawing on multiple climate and demographic models, Thiery and 36 colleagues compared the risks faced by previous generations to the number of extreme events today’s children will witness in their lifetimes. <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">Unless world leaders agree on more ambitious policies when they meet for the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, this fall, the study says, today’s children will be exposed to an average of five times more disasters than if they lived 150 years ago.</span>.</q></p>

				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p>In the last paragraph of the entire essay, the author quotes the story of a participant taking part in the studies that investigate early indicators of dementia. In this story, the author's writing implies some positive aspects of understanding whether you have an early development of dementia. For example, the author shows that the odds of Alzheimer's disease is <q>lower than the participant had feared</q>. The author also quotes the participant's positive attitude toward the understanding of the risk despite the need to share their personal data, like <q>I would want to use them. I'd rather know than not</q>. Thus, we can see that in general, the author tries to convince people that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">there are more advantages than disadvantages to use your personal data to reveal your chance of having dementia and it's better to get fully prepared</span>.</p>
				<p class="quote"><q>Paul Gondek, 68, who lives in Philadelphia and teaches social psychology at Drexel University, chose to learn his risk status two years ago, volunteering for several studies at the Penn Memory Center. Alzheimer’s tends to run in families and, having watched his mother’s slow decline from the disease, he knew he had a higher chance of developing it. To Mr. Gondek’s relief, the PET scan showed that he did not have elevated amounts of amyloid in his brain. And a calculated risk score showed that his odds of Alzheimer’s by age 85 were about 19 percent — higher than the 11 percent risk for the general population, but lower than he had feared. If other early indicators were available through driving or financial records or other behaviors and were reliable, he said, “I would want to use them. I’d rather know than not.”</q></p>
