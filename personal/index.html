        Hello! My name is Pei-Yu, Shih. You can also call me Amy! I am from Nantou, and I am now in my sophomore year of Department of Foreign Languages and Literature in NTHU. My hobbies are watching movies, listening to music, and cooking. While watching movies, I can indulge myself in the exciting and dramatic plot and forget about annoyances temporarily. In addition, movies have given me lessons about attitudes toward life and inspired me a lot in my daily life. As for music, listening to songs which are able to portrait my mood or cheer me up is my daily routine. The magic of music is that an uplifting song could make me dance with it, and that a soft acoustic song could calm me down. Cooking is an activity I enjoy doing with my families in weekends and vacations since I have been far from home for studying in senior high school and university. During long vacations, I always cook with my sister for my families. Though I am not a professional chef, it is such a pleasure for me to serve delicious dishes for people I love. “Seize every moment and opportunity in this amazing life journey.” is what I have learned from several movies I have watched, which is also a motto for my life.
