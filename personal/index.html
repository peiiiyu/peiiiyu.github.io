            <h1> Hello! </h1>
            <p>I am Pei-Yu, Shih. You can also call me Amy! I am from Nantou, and I am now in my sophomore year of Department of Foreign Languages and Literature in NTHU. My hobbies are watching movies, listening to music, and cooking. While watching movies, I can indulge myself in the exciting and dramatic plot and forget about annoyances temporarily. In addition, movies have given me lessons about attitudes toward life and inspired me a lot in my daily life. “Seize every moment and opportunity in this amazing life journey.” is what I have learned from several movies I have watched, which is also a goal for my life. As for music, listening to songs which are able to portrait my mood or cheer me up is my daily routine. The magic of music is that an uplifting song could make me dance with it, and that a soft acoustic song could give me peace of mind. Since I have been far from home for studying in senior high school and university, cooking is what I enjoy doing with my families in weekends and vacations. During long vacations, my sister and I always cook for my families. Though I am not a professional chef, it is such a pleasure for me to serve delicious dishes for people I love. I think I could not live without doing these things, because they are what motivate me to fulfill my life goal!</p><br/>

            <p>哈囉！我是施沛榆，你也可以稱我為Amy！我來自南投，現在是國立清華大學外語系的二年級生。我的興趣是看電影、聽音樂跟烹飪。<br/>
            每當看電影時，我能讓自己沉浸於刺激與精彩的情節中、暫時忘記其他煩惱，且電影亦教會我該抱持什麼樣的人生態度，也經常讓我在日常生活中迸發出靈感。「把握這精彩人生旅程的每一個瞬間與機會。」是我從觀賞過的電影中學到的，同時也是我的人生目標。至於音樂呢，聽一些符合我當下心情的音樂或能使我提振精神的歌曲是我每日的例行公事。音樂的魔力在於我可以隨著一首振奮的歌曲起舞，也能因一首抒情的原聲吉他歌曲而獲得平靜。因為從高中至大學我都離家求學，所以我很享受與我的家人們在周末與假期一起烹飪。長假期間，我與我姊姊總會為家人們下廚。雖然我並不是專業廚師，但能為我愛的人們準備美味的餐點是極大的榮幸。我想，這些興趣在我人生中是不可或缺的，因為他們就是讓我實踐人生目標的動力！</p>
