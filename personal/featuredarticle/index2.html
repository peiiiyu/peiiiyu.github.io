            	An Introduction to A Mysterious Musician - Colde (콜드)
                </h1>

            	<h2 style="text-align: center;">
            	 <b>Colde</b>: The combination of the word <b>“cold”</b> and <b>“blue”</b>.
            	</h2>

            	<p>
            		Colde, a Korean singer-songwriter, known for his unique and laid-back voice, was debuted on SoundCloud as a member of the indie duo <b>OFFONOFF</b> in 2015. He debuted as a solo artist in 2018, who has released three albums so far, which are <b><i>Wave</b></i> (2018), <i><b>Love Part 1</i></b> (2019), and <b><i>Idealism</b></i> (2021). Meanwhile, he founded his own label – WAVY in the same year. In recent years, he has recruited some promising young talents into his label. Colde always keeps a low profile because he once said that he is not comfortable with the public’s look. Nonetheless, I think his talent are worthy to share with people who enter this website!

                <p>
            	As the title says, he is a mysterious artist, so there is not too much information of his early life. He was in Department of Arts in a college, and that was how he met his partner in <b>OFFONOFF</b> - 0channel. They decided to take off their music career as a duo.</br>
            	(Fun fact: Due to their specialties on arts, not only did they make songs, but they also designed visual arts of their music video as well as the cover of albums by themselves.)

            	<h3>About OFFONOFF</h3>

            	<b>OFFONOFF</b> consists of Colde (vocalist) and 0channel (producer). The genre of their music are contemporary R&B and electronica. Thanks to <b>OFFONOFF</b>’s songs, I got to know Colde. It was on a rainy night while I first listened to their songs. I was listening to a random Korean songs playlist which is created for studying by someone I did not know. I was fascinated by a song of them, which is <b><i>Dance</b></i>. Colde’s voice has impressed me a lot in the beginning of this song. Some rapping might exhaust me to understand what they are rapping about, but Colde’s rapping in this song makes me feel comfortable and enjoyable. </br>

            	<p>
                After listening to <b><i>Dance</b></i>, I searched for this duo and listened to each of their songs. Their songs are like El Dorado for me because I had never listened to this genre of songs before. The other song of OFFONOFF I like the most is <b><i>Cigarette</b></i> (Feat. Tablo & MISO). I really like the atmosphere of this song, including the instrument, lyrics, vocal, and rapping. In addition, the lyrics of this song are written in English, so it is easy to understand even if listeners could not understand Korean. However, since they both want to explore different fields, they have stopped the activities <b>OFFONOFF</b> temporarily since 2018.</br>

            	<h3>About Colde's Solo Activities</h3>
                <p>
            	In 2018, Colde showed up at a Korean TV show called <b>“Breakers”</b>, which meant that he was ready to start a career as a solo artist. He made a song - <b><i>Your Dog Loves You</b></i> (feat. Crush) for this program, which is a soft song illustrating his love towards his dog. After the showing up on program, he started his own career and released three albums mentioned above. I think it would be a wonderful experience for you to listen to them.</br>

                <p>
            	Lastly, I would like to recommend one single of him. <b><i>Control Me</b></i> is a song perfectly showing the charm of Colde’s lazy singing. Lyrics are about a person crazy for and could be controlled by his/her lover completely. </br>
